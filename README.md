# Learning ROS

![OS: Ubuntu 20.04][os-tag] ![ROS Version: Neotic Ninjemys][rosversion-tag]

This repository strives to serve as a starting point towards the journey of learning ROS. This repository also strives to be a reference point for ROS resources.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, it is important to get a few things set up. Make sure you have:

1. A computer running Ubuntu. Though other operating systems also support ROS, this repository primarily focuses on **Ubuntu 20.04 (focal)**. Download it from [here][ubuntu-download].
    > If you intend to dual boot, you can check [this][ubuntu-dualboot] out.
2. A successful installation of ROS. This repository focuses on **ROS Noetic Ninjemys**.
    > Read [this][ros-installation] for knowing how to install ROS on Ubuntu. Make sure that you have sourced `/opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash` file in the `~/.bashrc` (to initialize ROS in terminals).
3. A useable editor.

    For C++: This repository uses **KDevelop**. Get it from [here](https://www.kdevelop.org/). More about it [here](http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#KDevelop).
    > Install [kdevelop-python](https://apps.kde.org/en/kdev-python) if you plan to use it for Python as well.

    For Python (and others): This repository uses **VSCode** (extensions and intellisense is great). Get it from [here][vscode-website].
    > Useful VSCode extensions: [C++][vscode-ext-cpp], [Python][vscode-ext-python] and [ROS][vscode-ext-ros].

### Repository structure

This repository consists of various packages that one needs to get started. This entire repository resides within a single workspace.

> _Package_: A package is a folder that contains the source material for accomplishing a particular task.

> _Workspace_: A workspace consists of source code for packages, files built using those source code and many other items ROS related. It's everything in a single folder.

The following points can be kept in mind:

- This entire repository is made as a workspace. So all the code files are divided into packages. It's suggested that you try writing your own code and use these files just for reference. However, you can directly copy packages (as folders) from this repository as well.

## Content

This section describes the main contents of this repository. Let's first start with creating the workspace and sourcing it.

### Setting up the workspace

1. The workspace is created by first creating a folder (with an `src` folder in it)

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/ros_workspaces/learning_ws/src/
    ```

    The folder `~/ros_workspaces/learning_ws` will be called our **workspace directory** (you can use any folder). This folder (this repository folder) is actually the workspace directory.
2. After creating folders, you have to build an empty workspace. That is done by going into the workspace directory and then running `catkin_make`.

    ```bash
    cd ~/ros_workspaces/learning_ws/
    catkin_make
    ```

    You must see messages showing the entire build process. And after the build, in your workspace folder, two more folders would have been created (these are not shown in this repository).
    - The `build` folder contains the build files for catkin. Catkin is a tool used to build ROS packages (made over cmake).
    - The `devel` folder has some developed files for the workspace. Of these, the `devel/setup.bash` has prime importance. The **workspace is discovered only after sourcing** this file.

        ```bash
        source ./devel/setup.bash
        echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
        ```

        You will note that the current workspace is now included in the ROS packages path. You might want to source this `setup.bash` file in the `~/.bashrc` as well (so that this is sourced every time you open a new terminal).
    - Additionally, a `src/CMakeLists.txt` file would also have been created. This is for CMake and should not be altered in any way (do not edit this file, it actually points to the original top level CMake that comes with the ROS installation).

> _roswiki_: The official tutorial can be found on [roswiki][roswiki-iac].

### Tutorial

A simple practical tutorial can be found in the file [tutorial1.md](./tutorial1.md). This includes basic keywords and an activity for getting started.

> Check out [tutorial1.md](./tutorial1.md) for the first tutorial.

### Main content

The main code of this repository is divided into packages and presented in the `./src/` folder. You are strongly suggested to go through the README of the [src](./src/README.md) as well as individual packages first, before trying them out.

> Go to the [src/README.md](./src/README.md) file.
